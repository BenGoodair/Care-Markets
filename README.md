Welcome to a holding repository for reproduction files for a research paper on children's home ownership, quality and location.

The folder will be completed upon finalising of the paper with functions to re-produce each analysis from raw data.

For now, a file containing the code used to produce a submitted version of the paper is available in the code folder, and the results, saved to the tables and figures folder - to support any reviewers analysing the production of the research. Much of the data, though not all for now, is available in the data folder of this repo.
