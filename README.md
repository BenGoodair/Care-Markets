Welcome to a holding repository for reproduction files for a research paper on children's home ownership, quality and location.

The folder will be completed upon finalising of the paper with functions to produce each analysis.

For now, a file containing the code used to produce a submitted version of the paper is available in the code folder, and the results, saved to the tables and figures folder - to support any reviewers analysing the production of the research.

Please reach out to b.goodair@lse.ac.uk for questions
